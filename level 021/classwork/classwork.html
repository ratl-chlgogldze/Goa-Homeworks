        <h1>Porsche</h1>
        <p>
            Porsche is a German automobile manufacturer specializing in luxury, high-performance sports cars, SUVs and sedans, headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The company is owned by Volkswagen AG, a controlling stake of which is owned by Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Porsche's current lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and Taycan.
            The origins of the company date to the 1930s when Czech-German automotive engineer Ferdinand Porsche founded Porsche[4] with Adolf Rosenberger, a keystone figure in the creation of German automotive manufacturer and Audi precursor Auto Union,[5] and Austrian businessman Anton Piëch, who was, at the time, also Ferdinand Porsche's son in law. In its early days, it was contracted by the German government to create a vehicle for the masses, which later became the Volkswagen Beetle. After World War II, when Ferdinand would be arrested for war crimes, his son Ferry Porsche began building his own car, which would result in the Porsche 356.
            In 2009, Porsche entered an agreement with Volkswagen to create an 'integrated working group' by merging the two companies' car manufacturing operations.[7][8] By 2015, Porsche SE, the holding company spun off from the original Porsche firm, had a controlling interest in the Volkswagen Group, which included Audi and Lamborghini as subsidiaries.

            <h2>History</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>
                Ferdinand Porsche (1875-1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[4] with Adolf Rosenberger[10] and Anton Piëch in 1931.[11] The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German, Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa lit. 'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree' Ferdinand Porsche. The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[4] This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time. Later, the Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.
                Porsche's tank prototype, the "Porsche Tiger", that lost to Henschel & Son's Tiger I Panzerjäger Elefant - after the loss of the contract to the Tiger I, Porsche recycled his design into a tank destroyer.
                During World War II,[14] Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen,[14] 52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen,[14] 15,584 produced.[15] Porsche produced several designs for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the closing stages of the war, producing two prototypes.[16] Ferdinand Porsche's biographer, Fabian Müller, wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories during the war. The workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche", but for "Poland".[17]

            <h3>developments</h3>
            <p>
                In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.

            <h3>Relationship with Volkswagen</h3>
            <p>
                The company has always had a close relationship with, initially, the Volkswagen (VW) marque, and later, the Volkswagen Group (which also owns Audi AG), because the first Volkswagen Beetle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche.
                The two companies collaborated in 1969 to make the VW-Porsche 914 and 914-6, whereby the 914-6 had a Porsche engine, and the 914 had a Volkswagen engine. Further collaboration in 1976 resulted in the Porsche 912E (US only) and the Porsche 924, which used many Audi components, and was built at Audi's Neckarsulm factory, which had been NSU's. Porsche 944s were also built there,[34] although they used far fewer Volkswagen components. The Cayenne, introduced in 2002, shares its chassis with the Volkswagen Touareg and the Audi Q7, which is built at the Volkswagen Group factory in Bratislava, Slovakia.

        <h2>Ferdinand Porsche</h2>
        <p>
            Ferdinand Porsche[a] (3 September 1875 - 30 January 1951) was a German-Bohemian automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche AG. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Auto Union racing cars, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, and several other important developments and Porsche automobiles.
            An important contributor to the German war effort during World War II,[1] Porsche was involved in the production of advanced tanks such as the VK 45.01 (P), the Elefant (initially called "Ferdinand") self-propelled gun, and the Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank, as well as other weapon systems, including the V-1 flying bomb.[2] Porsche was a member of the Nazi Party and an officer of the Schutzstaffel (SS).[3][4] He was a recipient of the German National Prize for Art and Science, the SS-Ehrenring and the War Merit Cross.
            Porsche was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1996 and was named the Car Engineer of the Century in 1999.
