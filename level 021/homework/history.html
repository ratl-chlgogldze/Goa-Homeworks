            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>
                The original mountain bikes were modified heavy cruiser bicycles used for freewheeling down mountain trails. The sport became popular in the 1970s in Northern California, USA, with riders using older, single-speed balloon tire bicycles to ride down rugged hillsides. These modified bikes were called "ballooners" in California, "klunkers" in Colorado, and "dirt bombers" in Oregon. Joe Breeze, a bicycle frame builder, used this idea and developed what is considered the first mountain bike.

                It was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials, such as M4 aluminum. The first production mountain bike available was the 1979 Lawwill Pro Cruiser. The frame design was based on a frame that Don Koski fabricated from electrical conduit and a Schwinn Varsity frame. Mert Lawwill had Terry Knight of Oakland build the frames. The bikes sold for about $500 new and were made from 1979 though 1980 (approximate run of 600 bikes).

                The first mass production mountain bike was the Specialized Stumpjumper, first produced in 1981. With the rising popularity of mountain bikes, Randolph (Randy) Ross, executive vice president of Ross Bicycles Inc., was quoted in the New York Times saying I'd say these bikes are one of the biggest things that ever happened to the biking industry. Its basic look constitutes "a total shift in image" for the industry.

            <h2>Designs</h2>
            <p>Mountain bikes can usually be divided into four broad categories based on suspension configuration:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Rigid:</b> A mountain bike with large, knobby tires and straight handlebars, but with neither front nor rear suspension.</li>
                <li><b>Hardtail:</b> A mountain bike equipped with a suspension fork for the front wheel, but otherwise a rigid frame.</li>
                <li><b>Soft tail:</b> A recent addition, a mountain bike with pivots in the frame but no rear shock. The flex of the frame absorbs some vibrations. These bikes are usually cross-country bikes.</li>
                <li><b>Full suspension (or dual suspension):</b> A mountain bike equipped with both front and rear suspension. The front suspension is usually a telescopic fork similar to that of a motorcycle, and the rear is suspended by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock.</li>
            </ul>
