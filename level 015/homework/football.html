    <h1>Football</h1>

    <p>Football, also known as soccer in some places, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The goal of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opponent's goal. Players use their feet to kick the ball, but they can also use their heads or bodies to control or pass it.
       Football is played on a rectangular field with goals at each end. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the game wins. Matches are typically divided into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a break in between.
       To move the ball up the field, players pass it to each other, dribble it by running with it at their feet, or shoot it towards the goal to try and score. Defenders try to stop the opposing team from scoring, while goalkeepers specifically guard their team's goal.
       Football is popular worldwide and is known for its fast pace, skillful play, and passionate fans. It's played professionally in leagues around the world and is also enjoyed recreationally by millions of people of all ages.
