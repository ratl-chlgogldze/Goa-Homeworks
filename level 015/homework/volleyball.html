    <h1>Volleyball</h1>

    <p>Volleyball is a fun sport played between two teams, with six players on each side. The main goal is to send a ball over a net and make it land in the other team's court while preventing them from doing the same. Players use their hands to hit the ball, but they can't hold it or let it rest on them. Points are scored when the ball hits the ground in the opponent's court or if they can't return it properly. It's a fast-paced game that requires teamwork, skill, and quick reactions!</p>
