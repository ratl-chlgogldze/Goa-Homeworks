    <h1>Basketball</h1>

    <p>Basketball is a popular sport played between two teams of five players each. The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground.</p>

    <h3>Basic Rules:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Court: The game is played on a rectangular court with a hoop (basket) at each end. The court is divided into two main sections: the frontcourt (where the teams try to score) and the backcourt (where they defend).</li>
        <li>Scoring: Teams score points by shooting the basketball through the opponent's hoop. A shot from outside the three-point line earns three points, while a shot from inside the line earns two points. Free throws are worth one point and are awarded for certain fouls.</li>
        <li>Game Duration: A standard basketball game consists of four quarters, each lasting around 10-12 minutes (actual time can vary). There are breaks between quarters and halftime for teams to rest and strategize.</li>
    </ul>
